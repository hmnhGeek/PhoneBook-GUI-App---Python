===============================

1. Change your user id and password
------------------------------------
Now you can change your ePhoneBook user id and password.
What you need to do is just click on Help in menubar of the login page,
then click on "Change my login details". You will be asked to login. 
Login with your current id and password, then change your id or password
or both after successful login.

2. Send email to any of your contacts
-------------------------------------
Yes, you can now send a plain text email to anyone in your contact list 
by just clicking on their email id. You will be then taken to login page.
Just login with your "Email ID". If you use gmail, don't enter smtp server 
and smtp port number that you will be asked for in the login, else, you have 
to enter it. If you don't know your smtp server and smtp port, then just
click the link on login page that says "Find my server and port", after you
enter your email id. Please don't click this link without entering your 
email id.
